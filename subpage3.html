			For this assignment, we were asked to create a poster on any subject matter, as long as it conveyed information and was not purely aesthetic. For my poster, I decided to make it about the BLM movement which I am passionate about, and specifically highlight Breonna Taylor's case. I was inspired by the song "The Revolution Will Not be Televised" by Gil Scott Heron, and decided to do a play on the song for modern times.
